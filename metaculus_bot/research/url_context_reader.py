"""One Gemini ``url_context`` read, shared by the two surfaces that pay for one.

Gap-fill v2's ``read_document`` tool has spent this call since 2026-07; the Tier-1
resolution-source ladder gained it on 2026-09-03 as its last rung, behind its own flag. Both
want exactly the same thing — hand Gemini a URL, get back what it read, and know whether it
actually retrieved anything — so the call lives here once and each caller supplies its own
model, thinking level, timeout, attempts and telemetry role.

The RETRIEVAL COUNT is the reason this returns a tuple rather than a string, and it is
load-bearing on both surfaces: Gemini answers fluently from parametric memory when every
retrieval failed (Q38195, 2026-07-19 — 30 search queries, 0 grounding chunks, a confident
fabricated contract table with fake ``[primary]`` tags reached forecasters). A caller that
cannot tell those apart cannot honestly label what it renders, so the count comes back and the
caller withholds on zero.

This module makes NO policy decisions: no size gate, no robots pre-check, no flag. Those belong
to the callers, because the two answer them differently — v2 serves a document it already holds
from a local digest, while Tier-1 refuses the read outright when the flag is off.

    number whether the fetch was refused, timed out, or the tool never ran, and those are
    different problems.

    Synchronous on purpose: the SDK is, both callers run it under ``asyncio.to_thread``, and the
    client-side ``timeout_ms`` is what returns the worker — an ``asyncio.wait_for`` around a
    thread cancels the coroutine and not the thread, so without a client ceiling a hung endpoint
    leaks a worker into the shared pool. ``attempts`` comes with it because the SDK retries
    NOTHING by default (``retry_args(None)`` is ``stop_after_attempt(1)``), which is how two
