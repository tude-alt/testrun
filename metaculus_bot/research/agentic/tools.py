"""The four tools the gap-fill v2 driver calls, and this caller's half of the fetch ladder.

The handlers are here (``search_news``, ``search_web``, ``fetch``, ``read_document``) and so is
``build_gap_fill_tools``, whose list order is the order the driver sees. What used to be here and is
not any more is the ladder itself: ``fetch`` and ``read_document``'s free acquisition both run the
SHARED ladder through ``_fetch_via_ladder``, which calls ``fetch_ladder.ladder.fetch_url`` under one
of the three gap-fill presets and maps what comes back through ``ladder_adapter``. The loop's
former duplicate rungs have been removed; the shared ladder is now the only fetch implementation.

What stays this caller's: the window presentation that serves ``start_char`` continuations, the
question-platform refusal that runs before anything is dialed, the throttle-phrase check on a body
the ladder read, the auto-escalation to ``read_document``, the paid reader and its robots pre-check,
and the two shared fetch markers emitted after each tool call. Support pieces live next door:
``tool_descriptions`` (driver-facing text and JSON schemas), ``tool_backends`` (the AskNews, Exa and
Gemini calls), ``fetch_outcomes`` (this ladder's result type and its refusals), ``local_document``
(what the free ladder holds, and the digest ``read_document`` serves), ``ladder_adapter`` (the two
vocabularies' one meeting point).

The seams the suite monkeypatches — ``_fetch_via_ladder``, ``_acquire_local_document``,
``_run_document_read_sync``, ``read_document``, ``_READ_DOCUMENT_TIMEOUT_S`` — are attributes of THIS
module and resolved here at call time. The ladder's own seams (``direct_fetch._fetch_direct``,
``rungs._rendered_rung``, ``rungs.render_page``, ``rungs.fetch_impersonated``) are patched there.
