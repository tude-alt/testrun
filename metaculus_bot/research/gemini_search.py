Uses the `google-genai` SDK directly (NOT via OpenRouter) so we get real

Metaculus Fall 2025 writeup identified research breadth as the single
strongest predictor of winning bots.

# forecaster a bracket field where some brackets resolve and some are decoration, with nothing to
# tell them apart (scratch/residual_2026-08-31/gemini_search_audit/cutB_pattern.md §3.1).
#
# A dotted run only counts as an index when it is DELIMITED the way a citation is — sitting at a
# group edge or against whitespace/``,``/``;``/``:`` — and when every component is at most two
# digits. Both bounds are measured, not guessed: across the 2,609 archived bracket groups that
# hold a dotted token, first components run 1..6 and the largest component anywhere is 39. The
# two-digit bound is therefore comfortably above real indices while excluding the content classes
# that would otherwise match — a year (``[2026.08]``), an IP octet (``[192.168.1.1]``) — and the
# delimiter rule excludes a quantity (``[3.8%]``, ``[$1.5]``, ``[1.5 million]``) and a version
# (``[v2.1.3]``). Zero of those 2,609 groups is anything but a citation index (validation:
# scratch/next_season_bundle_2026-09/item3_citation_strip/VALIDATION.md).
#
# What a bracket group IS, where its items split, and how a rewritten one is put back
# together all come from ``research/bracket_groups.py`` — the same grammar the attribution
# check reads the same text through immediately after this pass, so the two cannot come to
