"""Shared google-genai HTTP configuration for the two native Gemini call sites.

The grounded-search provider (``research/gemini_search.py``) and gap-fill v2's
``read_document`` backend (``research/agentic/tool_backends.py``) are the only places that
call Google's API directly rather than through OpenRouter, and both need the same two
things off ``HttpOptions``: a client-side timeout, and a retry ladder. The SDK ships
NEITHER by default — ``google.genai._api_client.retry_args(None)`` returns
``stop_after_attempt(1)``, so a bare client never retries anything, which is why two
production document reads died outright on a ``503 UNAVAILABLE`` that one retry would
have absorbed.

One builder so those two call sites cannot drift apart on which statuses are worth a
second request. The timeout and attempt count stay with each CALLER, because each is
sized against a different outer deadline (see the arithmetic in ``constants.py`` beside
``GEMINI_SEARCH_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS`` and in ``tool_backends.py`` beside
``_READ_DOCUMENT_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS``).
