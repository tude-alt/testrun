"""Markdown assembly for the research bundle: provider headers and heading levels.

Split out of ``orchestrator.py``: how a provider's text is LABELLED and stitched into
one document is presentation, and it is independent of how the providers were chosen,
run, or budgeted. Everything here is pure — no I/O, no orchestrator state — which is
why it is all plain module functions and directly unit-testable.

``PROVIDER_SECTION_HEADERS`` is the one provider-to-header map in the repo, and it is
read in BOTH directions: ``provider_header`` reads it forwards to label a section, and
``detect_providers`` walks it backwards to decode which providers a historical bundle
carried.
