"""Research provider strategy abstraction.

`choose_provider_with_name` returns an async callable (and its name) that, given
a `MetaculusQuestion`, returns formatted research.  The selection is governed
by environment variables so the logic lives in one place instead of being in
`TemplateForecaster.run_research`.

Providers receive the full question (not just the text) so they can use
auxiliary fields like `id_of_question` for caching, `resolution_criteria` for
keyword extraction, and `scheduled_resolution_time` for backtest-leakage
defenses (see `prediction_market_provider.py`).
