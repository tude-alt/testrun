    ``blocked`` with an HTTP status in ``impersonated_fetch.IMPERSONATE_TRIGGER_STATUSES`` (403
    today), and both halves are load-bearing. ``blocked`` has four producers:
    ``_NON_OK_FETCH_STATUS`` maps 403, 406 and 429 to it, and :func:`_vetted_hop_target` returns
    it for a Metaculus self-reference hop carrying the REDIRECT's 301 or 302. The 403 test
    excludes that last case exactly, which matters: handing a URL this module refused to a second
    transport is the bypass the guard exists to prevent.

    The trigger set is the TRANSPORT's, read as a module attribute at call time rather than
    imported, for two reasons. It is the one trigger both fetchers share (gap-fill v2's ``fetch``
    and ``read_document`` ladders key on the same object), so the population cannot drift between
    them; and the test packages empty that attribute to decline the rung by default and restore the
    transport's own object in the tests that exercise it, which only bites on a read that resolves
    the name at call time.

    Excluded on purpose, each for its own reason. 429 is a throttle, not a fingerprint verdict,
    and retrying at once with a different fingerprint against a host that just asked us to slow
    down is the one shape where the retry could make our position worse; the 2026-09-04
    diagnostic measured impersonation helping only on 403s. 406 is a content-negotiation refusal,
    and impersonation changes the ``Accept`` headers as a side effect, so a 406 rung would be an
    untested guess. 401 is an authentication requirement no fingerprint changes, and is not even a
    ``blocked`` shape: absent from ``_NON_OK_FETCH_STATUS``, it falls through to ``error``. A 200
    carrying a challenge or throttle interstitial is not a representable trigger today, because
    Tier 1 has no throttle-phrase check (only gap-fill v2's ``fetch_outcomes`` has one) and such a
    page classifies as ``js_wall`` or ``thin_page``; FUTURE.md carries that entry, and the
    ``error`` with ``failure_class="tls"`` widening nothing has measured.

    gains reaches this rung with it rather than needing a second copy here.

    ``http_status`` is the IMPERSONATED response's 200, not the direct 403. The bytes came with a
    200 and that is the honest record: a rescue's fetch line reads ``status=ok http=200
    route=impersonate`` with no ``failure_class``, and the fact that the direct fetch was refused
    lives on the escalation line's ``from_status=blocked``, exactly as a Wayback rescue reports the
    snapshot's own status. This diverges from :func:`_rendered_rung`, which passes the direct
    status because there the direct GET also got a 200.

    URL's inner rungs hijack the page's route. These bytes are the cited page's own, so a
    ``pdf_local`` attempt belongs on the page's record, and a document rescue reads
    ``route=pdf_local``: the accounting a meta-refresh hop onto a PDF already produces, in the

    Measured 2026-09-04 from a GitHub Actions runner (``scripts/probes/fetch_diagnostic.py``): four
    Akamai-fronted federal hosts (bls.gov twice, one of them a PDF, cdc.gov and fsis.usda.gov)
    answered the bot's own client 403 and the same GET through ``curl_cffi`` with Chrome
    impersonation 200, so that refusal was a TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprint verdict and is recoverable
    client-side. The four hosts that also refused the impersonated GET (Cloudflare, CloudFront and
    DataDome fronts) are the egress-IP population and stay the Wayback and paid rungs' business.
    Free: no key, no model call, no spend.

    The transport is :mod:`metaculus_bot.research.impersonated_fetch`, which carries the SSRF
    invariants itself because libcurl never touches aiohttp's connect-time ``FilteringResolver``:
    it pre-resolves the host through the repo's own vetting predicate, pins the connection to the
    vetted address, re-guards and re-pins every redirect hop under the shared ``MAX_REDIRECTS``
    cap, and caps the body as the direct fetch does: the page cap for every body, and one re-dial
    under the document cap when a declared PDF aborts on the first, so a cited PDF between the two
    caps (one of the four measured recoverable URLs is a PDF) is read here as the direct path
    would have read it (:func:`_impersonate_or_record_the_skip` names the two constants).

    Ordered gates, cheapest first, after the trigger (:func:`_impersonate_rung_applies`). The kill
    switch (``impersonated_fetch.impersonation_enabled``, the transport's own reading of
    ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_IMPERSONATE_ENABLED``, ON by default in code unlike the paid rung's
    default-off) records ``impersonate_disabled``. The URL dialed is ``direct.url``, the hop that
    ANSWERED 403 rather than the cited URL, because :func:`_resolution_status_outcome` sets ``url``
    to the answering hop and that is the URL the host actually refused; when the two differ the
    landing is re-vetted through :func:`_landing_refused`, and a refusal is a decline with no
    attempt, the same helper :func:`_rendered_rung` runs. The rung's ATTEMPT stays keyed on the
    cited ``url``, which is what the escalation line names. The per-run memo
    (``impersonated_fetch.impersonation_refused``, keyed by the HOST that answered a block plus the
    exact URL dialed to reach it) records ``impersonate_host_refused``: a host that answered the
    impersonated client with a block status is not going to answer the next cited URL on it
    differently in the same run, and a chain that ended in one is not walked twice, while a host
    that merely redirected into the block keeps its other URLs. The memo is process-global and shared with
    gap-fill v2, whose ``fetch`` and ``read_document`` ladders write it too, so the earlier
    refusal it records may have been a v2 fetch of a URL no question ever cited. Then the wall
    budget, through :meth:`LadderContext.claim_rung_budget` with the meta-refresh hop's floor: one
    GET against a host that just answered us, no launch and no gate contended process-wide.

    Deliberately NO fast-path skip (:func:`_skip_for_fast_path`). That token separates "the
    question's close left no room for a browser" from "this rung ran out of the provider's own
    clock" and its docstring reserves it for the two EXPENSIVE rungs; this rung costs exactly what
    the meta-refresh hop costs, and the cheap rungs run on the fast path unchanged. Do not add the
    gate for symmetry.

    Outcomes. A decline from the transport (:class:`ImpersonateDeclined`) leaves the attempt FIRED
    and :func:`_run_rung` closes it on the direct status, which is the ``route=impersonate
    status=blocked`` record the archive wants: we tried the fingerprint and this is still the
    answer. The one exception is :class:`ImpersonateUnpinnable`, a hop whose host would not pin
    to a vetted public address, which is stamped on the attempt already started as its own skip
    rather than appended as a second one (the pattern :func:`_rendered_rung` uses for
    ``render_non_200``). On the first hop that is near-impossible in practice, since the direct
    fetch resolved this host through the filtering resolver moments earlier; on a later redirect
    hop it is a target the direct fetch never resolved, so the skip means the pin failed on some
    hop rather than that nothing was dialed. A non-200 answer stamps the rung's own outcome
    (``blocked`` for a still-403, so the escalation line reads ``rung=impersonate
    outcome=blocked``; ``not_found`` for a 404 or 410; ``error`` for anything else), memoizes the
    host when the status is block-shaped (``impersonated_fetch.IMPERSONATE_BLOCK_STATUSES``: the
    three ``blocked`` rows of the status table plus 401 and 503, which stamp ``error`` here and
    still switch the host off), and returns None. A 200 goes through
    :func:`_impersonated_body_outcome`, the same classification a direct 200 gets. A success or
    throttle is returned. An unreadable result is returned only when the caller's verdict sets
    ``escalate_rendered``; this restores gap-fill's browser follow-up while resolution-source
    retains its original direct refusal for the off-site rungs.

    """Render an unreadable page in headless Chromium and re-classify it, or None.

    Runs from the escalation ladder, outside the aiohttp response context, so no response is
    held open across a 12-35 s render. It does NOT run outside the per-host gate: the transport
    re-acquires the same loop-wide ``Semaphore(1)`` for the URL's host and holds it across the
    launch-cap queue, the launch, the navigation, the settle and the teardown, because Chromium
    dials that host itself. Both acquires are unbounded by design (FUTURE.md item 5), which is
    why the transport recomputes the navigation budget only once both are held.

    Self-bounding on the shared pattern: skipped below ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_RENDER_MIN_BUDGET_S``
    of remaining wall, and the navigation gets the remaining budget less the settle, capped at
    the transport's own 35 s — as a CEILING. The transport tightens it after the gates to what is
    actually left of the DEADLINE handed to it less the settle and the DOM read, or declines
    under its own floor before a browser is launched, so a goto that runs its budget out can
    still be settled and read. That deadline is the remaining budget LESS the transport's exit
    reserve (``RENDER_EXIT_RESERVE_MS``: the shared teardown bound plus a second for the launch
    and the driver stop), because the transport spends those after its DOM is in hand and this
    rung's own bound has to fit them too. Degrading to the direct result costs one page;
    overrunning the provider's outer ``wait_for`` costs every page the question already fetched.

    The whole transport call — queue, launch, navigation, DOM read and teardown — is ALSO held
    to the remaining budget with ``asyncio.wait_for``. That bounds when this rung stops WAITING,
    not when the transport stops RUNNING: ``wait_for`` cancels the render and then awaits its
    unwinding teardown, so the reserve above is what keeps that teardown inside the wall, and a
    render that runs every bound out hands its DOM back before the cut instead of being
    cancelled in its own exit. The receipt is ogimet.com (2026-09-03): the goto timed out at
    33 s as designed and ``page.content()`` then blocked for 40 s more, for a 76 s render against
    a 45 s wall. The two bounds are recorded apart, by the exception class the transport raises.
    Its own DOM-read bound raises :class:`RenderTimeout`: a browser ran and the page kept
    navigating, which is a fact about the page and is its own skip, ``render_timeout``, rather
    than ``renderer_unavailable`` — a cut-off render says nothing about whether Chromium works,
    and must not latch that warning. This rung's outer bound raises a bare ``TimeoutError``: the
    render was still queued behind the two gates, or the transport overran its exit reserve,
    neither of which is about the page, so it is recorded as ``wall_budget`` like the pre-gate
    floor check and the post-gate :class:`RenderBudgetExpired`. The direct result is what stands
    either way. The transport memoises a timed-out URL itself, at the raise site and only when a
    browser actually ran; with the reserve in place its DOM-read bound lands before this rung's
    outer cut even in the salvage shape (goto ran its budget out), so the memo is written there
    too. A memoised URL re-raises on the next question, so it is recorded the same way again.

    The rendered DOM re-enters :func:`_classify_html_body`, so a rescued page gets the same
    chart read, ARIA rewrite, floors and disclosure leads as a directly-fetched one — unless the
    browser was answered with something other than a 200. The direct GET got a 200 for this URL
    (that is the trigger), so a non-200 main-frame status is the edge telling the browser apart,
    and its markup (a 403 or 429 interstitial routinely clears the chrome floor) is not the page:
    the rung leaves the direct result standing and does not memoise, because a 429 is retryable;
    that is its own skip, ``render_non_200``. A DOM over ``RENDERED_DOM_MAX_CHARS`` is likewise a
    fact about the page and its own skip, ``render_dom_too_large`` (the transport raises
    :class:`RenderDomOverCeiling` for it), so neither inflates ``renderer_unavailable``. A main
    frame that landed on a host other than the one the browser's DNS pin covers is refused by the
    transport unread on its pre-read check, or discarded unpublished when the navigation commits
    during the read itself (:class:`RenderOffHost`), and is its own skip too, ``render_off_host``:
    a server-side redirect the route guard never sees, so a fact about the page rather than the
    install, and nothing from that render is published either way.
    When the DOM STILL carries nothing, the JSON the page fetched for itself is the last free
    route (:func:`_derived_api_from_harvest`) — a JavaScript dashboard's numbers arrive over XHR
    and are in its HTML at no wait condition. Only once that fails too is the URL memoized
    (:func:`note_rendered_no_text`), so a second URL on the same page in this run does not spend
    another launch to learn the same thing; that memo hit is its own skip, ``rendered_no_text``,
    so it never inflates the count the operator reads as the Chromium install having failed.

    The browser is handed ``direct.url``, the URL the direct fetch LANDED on once its redirect
    hops were followed and re-guarded, rather than the cited ``url``: the pin then covers the
    host that actually serves the content, which is also the host the landing check holds the
    browser to, and a page whose canonical form is one ordinary hop away (``example.com`` to
    ``www.example.com``) is not refused for taking it. When the two differ, the landing is
    re-vetted through :func:`_landing_refused`, the one home of that re-vet (shared with the
    impersonated retry, which dials ``direct.url`` for the same reason), because this is where
    the URL the browser dials is decided; the refusal is a decline rather than a terminal
    result, so this site returns None with no attempt. The render memos are keyed on
    the URL rendered; the classifier's base, and so the ``FetchResult.url`` a rescue carries onto
    the ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_FETCH`` line and into the published ``### <url>`` heading, is the URL
    the browser's main frame LANDED on (``RenderedPage.document_url``: the direct fetch's final
    hop, or a same-host hop past it); the rung's attempt stays keyed on the cited ``url``, which
    is what the escalation line names, so a per-URL join between the two lines keys on the
    escalation line; and the harvested feed is remembered for the cited URL's host, which is the
    host the next cited URL asks :func:`_derived_api_rung` about.
