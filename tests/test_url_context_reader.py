"""The one Gemini ``url_context`` read both paid surfaces share, and the prompt wrapped around it.

``url_context_reader`` is the one call both paying surfaces share: gap-fill v2's ``read_document``
tool and the Tier-1 resolution-source ladder's last rung. Neither renders raw retrieval output;
both render the MODEL'S ANSWER about a document, under a caption that calls the section primary
grading evidence, so the three instructions in ``build_document_prompt`` are what keep the answer
checkable at all: quotes instead of paraphrase, the document's own dates, and an explicit "this
does not address the ask" instead of a fluent answer assembled out of recall (the Q38195 failure:
30 search queries, 0 grounding chunks, a fabricated contract table in front of forecasters).

Each instruction gets its own test, pinned on the sentence that carries the rule rather than on
the whole prompt string, so rewording the surrounding wrapper is free and dropping a rule is not.

No network anywhere here: ``google.genai.Client`` is replaced at the seam the reader imports it
through, and the fake responses carry only what the reader and its two observers
(``log_gemini_usage``, ``extract_url_context_telemetry``) read. The contract pinned on the response
is that the text comes off the SDK's documented ``.text`` property (``None`` when the answer has no
text part, which must read as an empty answer rather than crash or fabricate), and that the
retrieval count and statuses come off the url_context metadata.
