"""Guards that a hung workflow step cannot hold a concurrency group for hours.

On 2026-08-19 the Azure Ubuntu mirror failed over and ``apt-get update`` hung inside
``playwright install --with-deps`` on four tournament runs. The step carried
``continue-on-error: true``, which covers a step that FAILS and not one that HANGS, and
no step-level ``timeout-minutes``, so each hang ran to the job-level backstop of 300
minutes while holding ``concurrency.group: ${{ github.workflow }}``. GitHub allows at
most one PENDING run per group and cancels the existing pending one when a new run
arrives, so 54 of the day's 68 fires were evicted, the group was held 18 of 24 hours,
and q45374 and q45375 opened and closed without a forecast.

The fix has two halves and this module pins both, because either alone leaves the hole:

1. Every step that shells out or touches the network declares its own
   ``timeout-minutes``. A step cap kills the process, lets ``continue-on-error`` do what
   it was already there for, and — where the step is not allowed to fail — reports a
   ``failure`` rather than the ``cancelled`` a job-level timeout reports, which is
   indistinguishable from a concurrency eviction.
2. Every job declares ``timeout-minutes`` at all, so nothing inherits GitHub's 360.

The numbers are sized in scratch/residual_2026-08-24/workflow_reliability_audit.md off
measured step durations (scratch/residual_2026-08-24/track_c_step_timings.json), with
one hard floor asserted here: the ``Run bot`` cap must clear the bot's OWN per-question
contract in constants.py, or the workflow silently truncates a run in the second it was
about to publish — the forfeit these caps exist to prevent. ``test_bot_basic.yaml``
shipped exactly that inversion, a 60-minute job cap over a 3600-second contract.
